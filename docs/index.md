# LemonSync
A tool for syncing local theme files with a live [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/) store.

## Installation

To install LemonSync, first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This comes with npm, the package manager for node.js applications. To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```
$ üçã npm -v
```

With npm you can now install LemonSync:
```
$ üçã [sudo] npm install lemonsync -g
```

### Uninstalling previous versions of LemonSync

If you have the Python version of LemonSync installed, you will need to uninstall it:

```
$ üçã sudo pip uninstall lemonsync
```

You can verify that you have LemonSync installed properly by running the following:

```
$ üçã which lemonsync
/Users/<youruser>/.npm/bin/lemonsync
```

_Note: You may need to start your terminal application after uninstalling previous versions of LemonSync._


## Usage

1. Download a theme from your [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/) store.

  "api_token": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ12345678910",
  "ignore_patterns": [ "*.tmp", ".git", "lemonsync.json" ]
}
```
