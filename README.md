# LemonSync
A tool for syncing local theme files with a live [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/) store.

## Installation

To install LemonSync, first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This comes with npm, the package manager for node.js applications. To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```
$ üçã  npm -v
```

With npm you can now install LemonSync:
```
$ üçã  [sudo] npm install lemonsync -g
```

## Usage

1. Download a theme from your [LemonStand](https://lemonstand.com/) store. 

2. Create a JSON file, **lemonsync.json** and place it in your theme folder. This JSON should contain the following data:

```
{
  "theme_code": "zest",
  "store": "http://yourstore.lemonstand.com",
  "api_token": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ12345678910",
  "ignore_patterns": [ "*.tmp", "*/.git*"]
}
```

[lemonsync.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomcornall/lemonsync-js/master/lemonsync.json)

3. From within the theme folder, run:

```
$ üçã  lemonsync
```

## Advanced Options


If you need to reset your theme you can pass the `--reset` argument to LemonSync. There are two
options for this argument, `local` and `remote`.

```
$ üçã  lemonsync --reset=local
```

This will completely replace the contents of the current directory with the contents of your remote theme. All files and folders will be removed. **This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution!**

```
$ üçã  lemonsync --reset=remote
```

This will completely replace the contents of your remote theme with the contents of the current directory.

**This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution! If not careful, you could end up deleting your entire remote theme!**
